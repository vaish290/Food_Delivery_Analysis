# Food_Delivery_Analysis

## 1. Week 2: Temporal Analysis of Food Delivery Optimization i
This report focuses on improving food delivery efficiency in urban areas by analyzing traffic, weather, and delivery times. It includes visualizations such as time-based trends and heatmaps to highlight peak delivery hours and delays. The project also explores AI-assisted design to refine visualization choices and optimize food delivery logistics.

After incorporating feedback from the peer review, several refinements were made to enhance the clarity and depth of insights.The scatterplot overlaying weather conditions and delivery times was introduced to highlight external factors affecting delays.Additionally, a boxplot was added to compare delivery times across different city types (Urban, Metropolitan, Semi-Urban), helping identify regional performance differences.The AI documentation was expanded to provide a detailed explanation of how AI contributed to visualization design and delivery route optimization.

## Week3: Geospatial Analysis of Food Delivery Optimization
This study examines how geographic factors influence food delivery performance. It utilizes geospatial visualizations to map delivery routes, analyze high-traffic zones, and optimize driver allocations.Manual adjustments were necessary for improving spatial clustering and distance-based insights.

## Week 4: Categorical & Linguistic Analysis of Food Delivery Optimization

This analysis focuses on categorical and linguistic aspects of food delivery, identifying popular food categories and their delivery patterns. It includes treemap visualizations for traffic conditions and word clouds for food trends. AI-assisted design helped generate visualization ideas, but manual data cleaning was needed for consistency.

## Week 5: Tree and Network Visualizations of Food Delivery Optimization
This report explores network-based analysis for food delivery, showing relationships between food type, vehicle type, traffic, and weather conditions. It includes tree and network graphs to visualize delays and optimize delivery strategies. AI recommendations helped refine the visual layout, but some automated suggestions were manually improved for clarity.
